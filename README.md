# Smart Meter Energy Forecasting

## Overview
This project aims to predict energy consumption for smart homes using aggregated smart meter data from the **CKW Open Data** platform. By leveraging machine learning models, I forecast energy demand for the next 24â€“72 hours to help users optimize their energy usage and reduce peak loads.

## Data Sources
- **Smart Meter Data**: Aggregated consumption data per location code.
- **Calendar Data**: Differentiation between weekdays and weekends.

## Features
- **Data Pipeline**: Data Pipeline: Fully automated pipeline for downloading and storing smart meter data.
- **Forecasting Model**: Machine learning-based energy consumption prediction.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation using Sphinx and MyST.
