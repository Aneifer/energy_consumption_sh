# Smart Meter Energy Forecasting

## Overview
This project aims to predict energy consumption for smart homes using aggregated smart meter data from the **CKW Open Data** platform. By leveraging machine learning models, we forecast energy demand for the next 24â€“72 hours to help users optimize their energy usage and reduce peak loads.

## Data Sources
- **Smart Meter Data**: Aggregated consumption data per postal code.
- **Weather Data**: Temperature and humidity data (to be integrated).
- **Calendar Data**: Differentiation between weekdays and weekends.

## Features
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated data collection, preprocessing, and storage.
- **Forecasting Model**: Machine learning-based energy consumption prediction.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing and deployment of new model versions.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation using Sphinx and MyST.
